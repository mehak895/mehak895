# Hi, I'm Mehak Mittal 👋

### Computer Science undergraduate exploring real-world software systems, AI use-cases, and product-focused development

I’m a B.Tech CSE student at Bennett University with a strong foundation in core computer science subjects and a growing interest in how scalable, user-centric software is built. I use GitHub primarily as a learning space — to study real projects, experiment with ideas, and gradually build reliable systems of my own.
